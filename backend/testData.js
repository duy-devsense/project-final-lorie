    instructions:
      "Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees.\nRub your chicken with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and sprinkle on 1 tsp of salt and  a tsp of ground black pepper.\nPut in oven for 35 minutes.  Remove from oven and let sit.  (if you dont have time to cook your chicken, you can buy a rotisserie from the store and shred about a 1  cup of the chicken.)\nUsing a large soup pot (large creuset is nice), turn  heat on to medium.  5. Once pot is hot, add the 1-tablespoon of olive oil, the onions, carrots  and the leek.\nAdd 1 tsp of salt and  a tsp of ground black pepper.\nOnce the onions are translucent, add the garlic and stir for 1-2 minutes.\nAdd the bay leaf, thyme and chili pepper flakes (if using).  Stir for 1-2 minutes.\nThen add the rice.  Stir the rice until well coated with oil and well combined with other ingredients.\nAdd 5 cups of the chicken stock.  Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and put the cover on the pot.  Stirring occasionally (so the rice doesnt settle), let simmer for about 45 minutes.\nIn the meantime, shred your roasted chicken breast into bite-sized pieces.\nAfter 45 minutes, your rice should have a porridge-like consistency (slightly more liquid present than in a risotto, but not as much as a soup).  13. Add your shredded chicken, mushrooms and peas.   Stir and cook for another 3-5 minutes.\nServe with a little parsley on top and enjoy hot!\nThe basmati rice is not nearly as starchy as a shorter grain rice, so you wont fully get a porridge like consistency here if you use it.  However, I use it in my recipe because it has greater nutritional benefits.",
